## [Rapid Prototyping Web Applications Using Node.js and MongoDB](http://techbus.safaribooksonline.com/video/web-development/9781491925416)
Webcast- Running time: 1:06:45 

Let's rapidly prototype a web application from scratch in as little time as possible! Our prototype will be a fully featured interactive web application that persists data and is written with as few lines of code as possible. In this hands-on webcast you will learn how to leverage Node.js and Express.js to quickly bootstrap a web server, tie in MongoDB to persist data, and display it all using dynamic HTML templates. Finally we'll wrap it with Twitter's Bootstrap framework so it has a nice level of polish!

- [Problem Solving - The missing ingredient for new programmers](http://techbus.safaribooksonline.com/9781491921685)  35 mins

	The real challenge of programming isn't learning a language's syntax—it's learning to creatively solve problems so you can build something great. In this one-of-a-kind webcast, author V. Anton Spraul breaks down some of the ways that programmers solve problems and teaches you how to 'Think Like a Programmer'.In this webcast we answer the questions:
    - What is "problem solving" for programmers, and why is it so important?
    - Can it be learned, or do some people just "get it"?
    - How can someone develop his or her problem-solving ability?
    - What are some of the basic techniques of problem-solving for programmers?

However, classic SQL-style aggregation cannot easily capture this underlying structure. This talk discusses how graph mining techniques can surface high-value insights from the relationships between logged events.

Rice University  with Scott Rixner, Joe Warren and Luay Nakhleh

![](https://d3f1iyfxxz8i1e.cloudfront.net/spotlights/image/400f640f6b34.jpg)

This two-part course (part 2 is available [here](https://www.coursera.org/course/principlescomputing2)) introduces the basic mathematical and programming principles that underlie much of Computer Science. Understanding these principles is crucial to the process of creating efficient and well-structured solutions for computational problems.
To get hands-on experience working with these concepts, we will use the Python programming language. The main focus of the class will be weekly mini-projects that build upon the mathematical and programming principles that are taught in the class. To keep the class fun and engaging, many of the projects will involve working with strategy-based games.

After completing this course, you will have a much stronger background in Computer Science and be capable of writing Python programs that are both efficient and well-structured. You will also have a better understanding of how to approach more complex computational problems. As always, our goal is to teach these principles of computing in a fun and exciting way. We look forward to seeing you in class!

Communicating risk - a perspective from an insurer 

Communicating risk makes risk transfer possible. Over the last tenyears we have observed a convergence of the insurance and capital markets. Insurance linked securities (ILS), such as catastrophe bonds, have become more popular by investors looking for ‘non-correlated’ risks.   
At the same time R has gained much momentum in the financial services industry as a tool of choice for risk analytics. 
The author has worked with R in a major insurance and reinsurance market and a major investment bank over the last 10 years and gained much experience in measuring, monitoring and communicating the performance of underwriters, who are portfolio risk selectors on behalf of insurance companies and their capital providers. 
The talk will give an overview of R packages and that have been introduced and used over the years to measure and communicate risk and performance in the insurance context.



**Anthony Goldbloom**

Kaggle is a community of over 300K data scientists who build 60K models per month to participate in our competitions. Kaggle is currently focused on building tooling that makes it easier for data scientists to collaborate and build off each other's work. This lightening talk will demo some of that functionality and show how it can be used by the R community to learn and push the state of the art

Towards a universal platform for data science

Today, R and Python are everywhere, their capabilities are deployed in a broad spectrum of ways. We have built and made accessible ElasticR, an on-line platform to broaden that spectrum and make R and Python even more Ubiquitous.

ElasticR enables everyone to seamlessly provision and control on any public or private cloud, any cluster, any cheap computing device, interactive dual environment (R+Python) engines and use them:

From an R+Python workbench or notebook, running in the browser, accessible collaboratively like a Google document from anywhere and any device including tablets and mobile phones.

From an R or Python command lines, to build programmatically, in a fully reproducible manner data science infrastructures, services, workflows, applications, dashboards, etc.

To embed R+Python capabilities, programmatically or interactively, in Microsoft Office documents, spreadsheets or presentations.

To enable data science-centric social networking and to make the sharing of data science artificats, static and interactive, as easy as sharing a file on dropbox 

To instrumentalize R+Python in the IoT realm and to create links between R+Python engines and the physical world.

The presentation will be an overview of the main concepts behind the platform's design and will include live demos of ElasticR on AWS, GCE, Azure and Raspberry Pis.

Excellent meetup - three high level speakers, lots of good info 
- On insurance, risk, terminology, R libraries, data visualization from Markus
- Kaggle competition insights from Anthony
- ElasticR - mind blowing demo of data science cloud platform (kind of Google spreadsheets with R and Python on AWS/Google cloud) from Karim.
