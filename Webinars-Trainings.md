[Problem Solving](http://techbus.safaribooksonline.com/9781491921685)  35 mins

The real challenge of programming isn't learning a language's syntax—it's learning to creatively solve problems so you can build something great. In this one-of-a-kind webcast, author V. Anton Spraul breaks down some of the ways that programmers solve problems and teaches you how to 'Think Like a Programmer'.In this webcast we answer the questions:
    - What is "problem solving" for programmers, and why is it so important?
    - Can it be learned, or do some people just "get it"?
    - How can someone develop his or her problem-solving ability?
    - What are some of the basic techniques of problem-solving for programmers?

[The Sushi Principle: Raw Data Is Better - Joseph Adler and Robert Johnson](http://techbus.safaribooksonline.com/9781491924143#) 40 mins

Description: 
Thirty years ago, data warehouses revolutionized data storage at big companies, storing summarized data in a strict structure and making it possible to efficiently analyze data. We believe that modern technology lets you adopt a simpler and more powerful scheme to organize historical data: time ordered raw event logs. In this session, we'll explain why raw data is better.

[Graph Mining for Log Data - David Andrzejewski](http://techbus.safaribooksonline.com/9781491924143#) 30 mins
Description: 

Many of the millions of events logged inside a given software system are not isolated occurrences, but rather links in richly interconnected causal chains. However, classic SQL-style aggregation cannot easily capture this underlying structure. This talk discusses how graph mining techniques can surface high-value insights from the relationships between logged events.

[Using Data from Many Streams to Drive Social Impact - India Swearingen](http://techbus.safaribooksonline.com/9781491924143#) 20 mins
Description: 
Social service organizations have a tough job when it comes to using data to drive social impact. With “world saving” goals and large scale impact, it's crucial these organizations leverage a variety of data streams and do more with less. But, pulling multiple data streams and leveraging partners can be a tricky one, this session walks through some ins-and-outs using United Way as one example.
