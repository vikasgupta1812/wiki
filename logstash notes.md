Getting Kibana Up and Running
http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/setup.html
The first time you access Kibana, you are prompted to define an index pattern that matches the name of one or more of your indices.

You can add index patterns at any time from the Settings tab

By default, Kibana connects to the Elasticsearch instance running on localhost. To connect to a different Elasticsearch instance, modify the Elasticsearch URL in the kibana.yml configuration file and restart Kibana.
