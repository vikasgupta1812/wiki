What is difference betweeb web service REST and web service SOAP


Web services are web application components. Web services can be published, found, and used on the Web.

####RSS
- RSS stands for Really Simple Syndication
- RSS allows you to syndicate your site content
- RSS defines an easy way to share and view headlines and content
- RSS files can be automatically updated
- RSS allows personalized views for different sites
- RSS is written in XML


####SOAP
- SOAP stands for Simple Object Access Protocol
- SOAP is an XML based protocol for accessing Web Services.
- SOAP is based on XML
- SOAP is a W3C recommendation


####Web Services
- Web services are application components
- Web services communicate using open protocols
- Web services are self-contained and self-describing
- Web services can be discovered using UDDI
- Web services can be used by other applications
- HTTP and XML is the basis for Web services


#####Interoperability has Highest Priority
- When all major platforms could access the Web using Web browsers, different platforms couldn't interact. For these platforms to work together, Web-applications were developed.
- Web-applications are simply applications that run on the web. These are built around the Web browser standards and can be used by any browser on any platform.

####Web Services take Web-applications to the Next Level
- By using Web services, your application can publish its function or message to the rest of the world.
- Web services use XML to code and to decode data, and SOAP to transport it (using open protocols).
- With Web services, your accounting department's Win 2k server's billing system can connect with your IT supplier's UNIX server.

####Web Services have Two Types of Uses
**Reusable application-components.**
There are things applications need very often. So why make these over and over again?
Web services can offer application-components like: currency conversion, weather reports, or even language translation as services.

**Connect existing software.**
Web services can help to solve the interoperability problem by giving different applications a way to link their data.
With Web services you can exchange data between different applications and different platforms.
