You must also be willing to take a leap of faith into your desired destination and away from the crown of procrastination, complacency, and mediocrity. IT'S TIME TO EXPERIENCE THE ABUNDANT LIFE!!!!

On your journey to success you will need a weapon (education) and armor (experience) you cannot survive without one of them and you cannot win without the other. If you really want to start making more money, retire, or just get involved in trading. Then please, I beg you, to really get, or give yourself a THOROUGH education. No matter what your profession, hobby, or passion is in life, every single day make it your goal to improve upon it and learn something new. ðŸ“š=ðŸ’²
Make 2 goals right now to complete by the end of the day.
What are your goals??

Knowledge is power ! Think about this: Who is going to do better in life; the ones that watch tv whole day or the ones that spend their time useful and improve themselves by reading and gathering information? It's up to you to answer that question.

Now think about 3 ways to get money, just to get started. Probably you are now thinking like:
1: A job
2: Maybe another job
3: Man, 3 is a lot and there's no way someone can handle 3 jobs. And how do you earn money in another way?

Most people with big ambitions start with the 2 jobs (or maybe 3) and then start thinking; how can I get more money? More sources of income? 
Maybe I can start a service or I can start building something like chairs or computers or ask people if they want me something to make for them.

You got to have an open mindset and be creative to find other and better sources of income.

Now think again of 3 ways of sources of income. 
Bet you came up with at least 5 now. You see, you got to have the right mindset to see all the possibilities.

And what are you going to do now?
Just like and scroll on to the next post?

No, if you really want to get somewhere you write down 10 ways to get money. And start asking people what they need, if you can make them something or start sollicitating for your 2 or 3 jobs. 
It is important to THINK, but even more important to DO.
