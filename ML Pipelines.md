Idea - Create something simlar to Azure ML using Caret
====

Start with simple and later (2nd round) add more complexity to the process. Most problems require application of simple concepts to solve them. (Andrew Ng., Sam Stokes). Its easy to explain. 



## Meetup: Streamline the workflow for data analytics (R caret vs. Azure ML studio)

http://www.meetup.com/data-science-dojo/events/221981185/

People always say eighty percent of data scientist's time is spent on data exploration and cleaning data. Usually you cannot get too much help from other folks in these steps, since the specific problems are very different from each other. 
However, situation dramatically changes after you obtaining a tidy data set. A lot of tools like R caret library, Azure ML Studio are just there helping you to make the model-building process easier. They streamline the workflow of data analytics by embedding several main processes like sampling, feature selection, parameter tuning, etc. 

In this meetup, we would talk about how such tools serve the data scientists by introducing:

The necessities of different processes of data analytics, including sampling, feature selection, parameter tuning of models, regularization, etc.Using R caret to build an optimized model for several data sets;Using Azure ML studio to build an optimized model for several data sets;Comparison between caret and Azure ML studio, and introducing some other similar streamline tools.

## Brute Force Machine Learning with R and Caret 

https://training.xebia.com/summer-specials/brute-force-machine-learning-with-r-and-caret/

Writeup - Properly training a model requires tedious tasks such as cross validation and experimenting with multiple parameters of a learning algorithm. Fortunately, these are automated in the Caret package of the R programming language. In one day, you will learn how to unlock the full potential of this package in order to create reliable models that match your business problems.

You will benefit from this type of activity\project if:

- you recently started or moved into a Data Science position,
- you want to know more about various aspects of model training,
- you have some R experience (e.g. creating and manipulating data frames, fitting a simple linear model).

After completing the 1-day training, you will know:

- about different ways to measure model accuracy,
- how to relate model accuracy to business impact,
- how to train reliable models.

You will have hands-on experience in:

- training models with Caret,
- using custom training parameters,
- using custom performance metrics,
- using parallel processing,
- applying models to make predictions on new data.

You will have the skills to:

- create R functions for computing model performance,
- parallelize R code to increase computation speed.

Organizations today are overly familiar with the complicated and often painful nature of handling the flood of data involved in their analytics process. It’s likely that you will need multiple tools to ingest, clean and merge your data before you can even start to build your models and analyze your datasets for business insights. And still more time as you integrate them into a visualization application to have the data ultimately reviewed by the business decision makers within any given organization.

In this webinar we will explore a new set of tools provided by `Alteryx` and `Qlik` that streamlines this otherwise highly inefficient process, making it simple, fast, intuitive, and cost-effective. You will gain deeper insights into your data within hours rather than weeks.

Speakers:

Michael Snow, Partner Marketing Director, Alteryx
Gene Rinas, Senior Solutions Engineer, Alteryx
Jesús Centeno, Alliances Technology Manager, Qlik

Hosted by: Tim Matteson, Cofounder, Data Science Central

## KeystoneML - 

http://keystone-ml.org/

Software framework designed to simplify the construction of large scale, end-to-end, machine learning pipelines with Apache Spark.

The alpha version of Keystone-ML will be of interest to Deep Learning fans as it achieves near state-of-the-art performance for image classification, state-of-the-art performance for phoneme classification (speech), and ships with a simple pipeline performing n-gram based document classification. It can scale to massive amounts of data and these pipelines result in significantly faster model training times.
